# pyhanabi
A game engine for creating and testing AI players to play the game [Hanabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanabi_(card_game)).

Built to allow experimentation with various artificial intelligence algorithms and not intended to be played by humans. Hanabi is an interesting game for AI methods because of the unconventional information and communication dynamics, and because human play relies on establishing heuristics with other players.

Open to feedback, pull requests and bug reports. 

Built for Python 2.7, on top of just the standard library.
